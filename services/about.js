      <h1 class="display-1 text-center">Hi.</h1>
      <p>
        I am a Daytime Emmy Award winning visual effects supervisor (2013, "Elmo The Musical", Sesame Workshop) and software developer. In VFX, I worked primarily through <a href="www.magneticdreams.com">Magnetic Dreams Animation Studio</a> for over 7 years serving as both visual effects supervisor and pipeline developer. In 2017 I left Magnetic Dreams to join <a href="www.clutch.io">Clutch</a> but have continued to push pixels for those muppets in a freelance capacity, most recently on Sesame's Streets 50 anniversary special (2020).

        My background was originally in film, having attended Watkins College of Art Design + Film. I'm co-owner of Untrademarked Productions, which produced our first feature film 'Worm' in 2013. Film led to Animation and VFX, where I have had a great relationship with Magnetic Dreams, with responsibilties ranging from art to code, that has lasted over a decade.

        As a developer / content-lead at Clutch I help drive the future of low-code developing, converting the components that make up Front Ends into product and design team-friendly building blocks that can be used in a visual manner.

        I enjoy cooking, walking, playing the bass and the scheme programming language of course.
